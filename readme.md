The sources for commandlua.github.io

Actual documentations is in mock/API.lua.

build.ps1 and build.bat are specific to my computer, and will require some tweaking to get to work elsewhere. You will need to have:

* Lua 5.2 or Lua 5.3 installed, and on the path.
* [LDoc installed](https://github.com/stevedonovan/LDoc)

More information can be found as part of the [LDoc documentation](https://github.com/stevedonovan/LDoc). Please contact me if you have any troubles.
